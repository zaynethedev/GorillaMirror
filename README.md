GorillaMirror is a mod for the game Gorilla Tag, adding a mirror with customizable FOV, and clipping.
Now this may look like a camera mod, but it isn't. It is a portable mirror!

## OPTIONS
### Option 1: FOV
Change your mirror's FOV from 160 FOV to 30 FOV! FOV is, well.. FOV.
### Option 2: NEAR CLIP
Change your mirror's Near Clip from 1 to 0.1! Near Clip is how close an object has to be to the camera before it stops rendering.
